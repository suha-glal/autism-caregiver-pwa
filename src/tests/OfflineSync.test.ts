// src/tests/OfflineSync.test.ts
/**
 * This file contains test scenarios for validating offline and sync behavior
 * 
 * These tests should be run manually to verify the application's behavior
 * in different network conditions.
 */

/**
 * Test Case 1: Offline Entry Creation
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Disconnect from the internet (turn off Wi-Fi or use browser dev tools)
 * 2. Log in to the application
 * 3. Create a new entry with a label and note
 * 4. Verify the entry is saved to localStorage
 * 5. Verify the offline indicator is displayed
 * 6. Verify the status message indicates offline storage
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Entry should be stored in localStorage
 * - UI should indicate offline status
 * - Status message should confirm local storage
 */

/**
 * Test Case 2: Automatic Sync on Reconnection
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. While offline, create multiple entries
 * 2. Reconnect to the internet
 * 3. Verify the offline indicator disappears
 * 4. Verify sync process starts automatically
 * 5. Verify status messages update to show sync progress
 * 6. Check Supabase database to confirm entries were synced
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Sync should start automatically on reconnection
 * - All offline entries should be sent to Supabase
 * - UI should update to show sync status
 * - Entries should appear in Supabase database
 */

/**
 * Test Case 3: Partial Sync Handling
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create entries offline
 * 2. Reconnect with unstable connection
 * 3. Observe sync behavior
 * 4. Verify partially synced state is handled correctly
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - Successfully synced entries should be removed from localStorage
 * - Failed entries should remain in localStorage for retry
 * - UI should indicate partial sync status
 */

/**
 * Test Case 4: Authentication Persistence
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Log in to the application
 * 2. Disconnect from the internet
 * 3. Refresh the page
 * 4. Verify authentication state is maintained
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - User should remain logged in after refresh while offline
 * - All offline functionality should be available
 */

/**
 * Test Case 5: PWA Installation and Offline Access
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Install the application as a PWA
 * 2. Disconnect from the internet
 * 3. Launch the PWA
 * 4. Verify the application loads and functions offline
 * 
 * Expected Result:
 * - PWA should launch successfully without internet
 * - All core functionality should work offline
 * - Previously cached data should be accessible
 */

/**
 * Manual Validation Checklist:
 * 
 * [ ] Offline indicator appears when offline
 * [ ] Form submissions work offline
 * [ ] Data is stored in localStorage when offline
 * [ ] Sync triggers automatically when connection is restored
 * [ ] Authentication persists during offline/online transitions
